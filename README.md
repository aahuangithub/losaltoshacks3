Open the .pdf or .pptx file in root directory for our presentation.

Bugs:

* First try opening any activity fails; open it again and it should work
* Occasionally gMaps API fails on me, not my fault
* Doing anything before the map loads results in an error
* ...You tell me!

Todo/future plans (don't ask for ETA):

* Photo collage
* In-game currency
* Server tech with user profiles
* Camera usage
* Fix bugs
